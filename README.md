# StudyBuddy
i just made an extension to help make a study guide, and decided to put it onto chrome and open source it so it can help other people


In standard markdown using the UTF8 symbol this looks pretty good:

### The Tools:
Just two for now, but there will likely be more in the future:
- Add to Study Guide in context menu to add the current page to the popup
- Paste text into the popup to save it

> I don't plan on updating this often. I'm busy with other projects, and for the time being, only plan on updating this when I need a new tool, or when somebody builds a new tool and opens a pull request.
